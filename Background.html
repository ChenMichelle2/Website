                        My heritage originates in Guangdong, China. My family immigrated to 
                        the United States in the late 1990's and early 2000's. My mother came to 
                        Boston at the age of 28. She would soon meet my dad at a dinner party her older sister
                        would invite her to. Soon after they got married and had their first and only child, a baby girl,
                        me. Born in Boston, raised in Quincy,MA my parents taught me our native language and kept 
                        our culture and heritage alive.

                As I got older I was put into Saturday classes, from math and english classes, Chinese, and dance.
                My elementary school experience consisted of school Monday to Friday, and extra classes morning to night on the weekends.
                With such a busy schedule, I was able to learn from a yung age how to manage my time with the 
                extra homework from my weekend classes. My escape from this was the internet, like many other kids during the early 
                2010s, I played many online MOBA games. 
                
                My love of online games and gamily only grew with age.
